Excel Sales Data Analysis Project

In this project, I worked with Excel to analyze and organize sales data effectively:
1. Data Import and Organization: Imported sales data and structured it into organized tables with key metrics, including dates, products, quantities, and prices.
2. Functions and Formulas: Used essential Excel functions like SUM and AVERAGE for calculating totals and averages across different metrics. Employed VLOOKUP for efficient data retrieval.
3. Data Visualization: Created pivot tables and charts to provide clear visual insights into sales performance and trends over time.
4. Data Validation and Formatting: Applied data validation to maintain accuracy and consistency across the dataset. Utilized conditional formatting to visually highlight key patterns and trends.
5. Reporting and Dashboards: Developed reports and dashboards that supported data-driven decision-making, helping to monitor sales performance and identify key drivers.

This project helped me strengthen my Excel skills in data organization, analysis, and visualization, making data-driven decisions easier for stakeholders.
